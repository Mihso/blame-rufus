Things to do before hand:

This project is made with Python and utilizes GitPython, so you would need to install it by typing in the command line:

    pip install GitPython


if other methods are needed, you can use:

    python setup.py install


download from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython


or clone using this method:

    git clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ./init-tests-after-clone.sh

----------------------
If you want to change what directory is checked, change the "git_dir" variable on line 30 to the desired local git repository path (using the same format shown in the example)

Then, you can run the program in either vscode or whatever program/bash/command line can run the Python programming language.

I took some time testing learning how to use GitPython and ensured that I could access local git repository information.
